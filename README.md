## Hi there 👋, I'm Hazal!

🎯 I'm working as a **.NET Backend Developer**. With a background in software engineering, I enjoy building robust and scalable systems.

💻 My main areas of interest include:

- C#, ASP.NET Core  
- RESTful API development  
- Website development with MVC  
- Software architecture & clean code principles  

🧩 I've taken part in enterprise-level projects using technologies like ASP.NET MVC, Web API (RESTful & SOAP), and .NET Core. In these projects, I have:

- Utilized architectural patterns such as **Layered Architecture**, **Clean Architecture**, **Onion Architecture**, and **CQRS**  
- Designed and optimized databases using **SQL**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **PostgreSQL**  
- Developed modern solutions with tools like **RabbitMQ**, **SignalR**, and **Docker**  

🐱 I'm a cat lover, and coffee keeps me going ☕  
🧠 Always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to open-source projects.
